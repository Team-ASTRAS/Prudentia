## GUI Servers Setup

# Create a single DataPackage class instance
sharedData = user.SharedDataPackage()

ip = '127.0.0.1' #Local Machine

# Start threads to begin websocket server and html server
# The websocket server is responsible for all data transfer between the GUI and Prudentia

websocketThread.start()

# The html server is responsible for delivering html content to the connecting user.
htmlThread = Thread(target=user.startHtmlServer, args=(sharedData, ip, 8009))

## IMU Serial Setup

#Create IMU class and open a connection
Imu = imu.ImuSingleton()
#conn = Imu.openConnection('com4', 9600)
#assert conn is not None #Make sure the port opened correctly

#Start thread to read data asynchronously

## Camera Setup
